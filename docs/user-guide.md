Once you click the sign-up button, you will be taken to a screen to
input information to create an account on SwooperMarket. The sign-up
asks for your first name, last name, Emory email, phone number, and 
password. In order to create an account in SwooperMarket, you will NEED
to have an Emory University affiliate email (an email that ends in
emory.edu), or else you will be unable to sign up. This is to ensure that
the only people using our website are Emory-affiliated people only.

Once you sign up, you will get an email sent to your Emory-affiliated
email to verify your account. Once and ONLY once you click the link will
you be able to log in to the website. Failure to click the link in
your email will result in a user not being able to log in. MAKE SURE TO
CHECK EVERY FOLDER OF YOUR EMAIL, EVEN SPAM/JUNK FOLDER, AS SOME EMAILS
MAY END UP THERE.

Once you click the link in the email, you will be redirected to the
login page where you can log in with your email and password that
you created.

Upon a successful login, you will be redirected to the homepage which
has all the items or listings currently available for sale. There are
many ways to filter through the listings including a specified price
range, condition, item category, and recent listings.

To get more information on an item, you can click it and it will expand
to include more details on the listing such as who is selling it, the
seller's email and phone number, description of the item, the condition,
and where the seller's preferred pickup location is. Scrolling more on
the page will reveal a comment section where users are able to
communicate with the seller about any questions they have about the
product. If a user is interested in the item, then they can either email
or text the seller via the information that is provided on the page.

navigation bar. The button will redirect you to a form where you can
upload information on any item you want to sell.

After you click the “List Item” button, your item will be listed on
the homepage and on your profile page.

To access your profile page, you can click the button titled “Profile”
on the navigation bar. The profile page includes information about
yourself. It has your name, email, phone number, a short bio you can
create, all the listings you currently are selling, and the ones you
sold in the past.

To edit your profile you can click the pencil icon near your name where
you will be able to edit your name, phone number, and bio.

you will be sent an email with a link to a page that will ask you to
create and confirm your new password.
