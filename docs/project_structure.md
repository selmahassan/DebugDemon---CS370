# SwooperMarket Project Structure

The SwooperMarket project uses Next.js, an open-source React framework used for building web applications. Specifically, the project uses the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), which is an upgrade from the previous Pages Router.

App Router is unique in how it has its routing built into its file and folder structure. See this Next.js [Project Structure](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure) page on an overview of the structure.
