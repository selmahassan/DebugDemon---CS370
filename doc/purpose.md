Currently, at Emory University, our undergraduate students have a group chat on the platform known as GroupMe for selling used or second-hand
items that are no longer wanted. This method is very unorganized. For starters, students will get hundreds of unnecessary notifications
for items they have no interest in. Everyone in the group chat gets unnecessary back-and-forth messages between random people. 
You can see below the unorganized method Emory Students have been using.



Our group wants to create an application that allows Emory students to list things they are selling efficiently and cleanly. 
Rather than looking through hundreds of messages to see if someone is selling something you want just to find out, it was already sold, 
SwooperMarket will provide an actual user interface for buyers and sellers to make and save some money. Our application provides many added benefits for Emory students that our competitors do not.
For starters, the users are all Emory students, faculty, and staff enabling most transactions to occur around the University.
Some of you may have experienced scams when shopping online, for example with concert tickets. Allowing only Emory personnel to access 
the app will hopefully make transactions safer and more trustworthy. These are two factors and user benefits our users cannot guarantee.
